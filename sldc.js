// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain
// Rinse & Repeat


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step more clearly defines the requirements that have been decided on in the planning stage, and includes the creation of documents that lay out the specifications of what features need to be designed and devloped during the project."
const design = "Using the requirements specified in the previous step, detailed planning of the design architecture or architectures necessary for the product devlopment are proposed, documented and reviewed in this step.  A design approach is selected to be implemented."
const implementation = "This is where the sausage gets made.  This is the actual code writing phase of the Lifecycle.  Developers follow the design generated in the previous step to build out the product or features as specified."
const testingAndIntegration = "The code goes to QA or is otherwise tested against a variety of use cases & edge cases.  Bugs and defects are reported, tracked fixed and then tested again until the product meets a standard of quality as laid out in the second phase of the SDLC. When that quality standard is met, the product is Deployed or Integrated into an existing codebase, meaning it is live and available to be used by the clients."
const maintain = "Code is updated, if necessary, based on feedback from users.  If things suddenly break, they are fixed as quickly as possible.  Above all, the team does the best to avoid the dreaded ske-wampus."
const rinseAndRepeat = "Most software is never truly finished, only deployed.  This process is repeated over again as new features are added, existing features are modified & new bugs/failure cases are discovered."
